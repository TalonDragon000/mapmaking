if you do see folders labeled as colors:

- Copy the TEMPLATE folder into the category you want to add an item (There should be one in each category, but if not, any TEMPLATE folder works)
- Place the copy into the "New" folder in said category (or make one if you don't see it) and name the folder as the name of the item (no caps)

- Put every image corresponding to each color of the item in their respective color folder
- The front layer of the item you want to add should be named "front"
- The back layer of the item you want to add should be named "back"
- The preview image of the item you want to add should be named "preview"
- Load the "New" Folder in the Dashboard after setting up the Type

- Wait until it's done uploading

- move the folder out of New
- you're done :3
