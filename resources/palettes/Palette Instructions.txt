To save the GatherPalette as Preset in Aseprite:

- Open "gather70.aseprite"
- Palette Menu (button with 3 lines) > Save Palette as Preset > Name it
- Optional Step: Palette Menu (button with 3 lines) > Save Palette as Default

In case you don't want it as a default, but you want to access it (or to other palettes):

Paint Palette Icon > Look for the name you gave to the palette > Double click it or click "Load"

In case the swatches are misaligned:
Select a black swatch > Ctrl + Click the surrounding edge to duplicate it and drag it.
The swatches will rearrange as you move it. Repeat the process for the palette to fit your window size :D
